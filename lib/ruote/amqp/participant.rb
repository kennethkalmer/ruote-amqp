module Ruote::Amqp

  #
  # This participant publishes messages on AMQP exchanges.
  #
  # == options
  #
  # A few options are supported. They can be declared at 3 levels:
  #
  # * options (when the participant is registered)
  #
  #   dashboard.register(
  #     'amqp_participant',
  #     Ruote::Amqp::Participant,
  #     :routing_key => 'nada.x')
  #
  # * params (from the process definition)
  #
  #   sequence do
  #     amqp_participant :routing_key => 'nada.x'
  #   end
  #
  # * fields (from the passing workitem)
  #
  #   sequence do
  #     set 'f:routing_key' => 'nada.x'
  #     amqp_participant
  #   end
  #
  # The 'conf' option (only available at participant registration) decides
  # which levels are enabled or not.
  #
  # By default 'conf' is set to 'params, fields, options'.
  #
  # === 'conf'
  #
  # As said above, this option decides who can tweak this participant's
  # options. It accepts a comma-separated list of levels.
  #
  # The levels are "params", "fields", "options".
  #
  # The order in which the levels are given is the order in which they
  # are investigated for values.
  #
  # === 'connection'
  #
  # A hash of connection options. This is direcly fed to the amqp gem, the
  # options of that gem apply thus ('host', 'port', 'vhost', 'username' and
  # 'password').
  #
  # If no 'connection' (or :connection) hash is passed, the participant
  # will attempt to use the connection (AMQP::Session) found in
  # Ruote::Amqp.session. If there is nothing in there, it will [attempt] to
  # create a new connection with AMQP's default settings.
  #
  # === 'exchange'
  #
  # Accepts a two or three sized Array.
  #
  # The first element is a string or symbol detailing the exchange type,
  # like :direct, :fanout, :topic, ...
  #
  # The second element is an exchange name.
  #
  # The third, optional, element is a hash of exchange options.
  #
  # There is more information at http://rubyamqp.info/
  #
  # By default, 'exchange' is set to [ 'direct', '' ] (the default exchange).
  #
  # Note: you cannot pass an instantiated Ruby-AMQP exchange here. Ruote
  # cannot serialize it for remote workers, so the settings are passed
  # in a flat form, easily JSONifiable.
  #
  # === 'field_prefix'
  #
  # Sometimes one wants to separate his AMQP participant settings from other
  # workitem fields.
  #
  #   dashboard.register(
  #     'amqp_participant',
  #     Ruote::Amqp::Participant,
  #     :conf => 'fields', :field_prefix => 'amqp_')
  #
  # registers a participant that draws is configuration from workitem fields
  # prefixed with 'amqp_'.
  #
  # Note that setting this option doesn't implicitely add 'fields' to the
  # 'conf' option.
  #
  # === 'forget'
  #
  # When set to true forces the participant to reply to the engine immediately
  # after the message got published, in a "fire and forget" fashion.
  #
  # === 'routing_key'
  #
  # Depending on the exchange used, this option lets you influence how the
  # exchange routes the message towards queues.
  #
  # Consult your AMQP documentation for more information.
  #
  # === 'message'
  #
  # By default, the workitem is turned into a JSON string and transmitted in
  # the AMQP message payload. If this 'message' option is set, its value is
  # used as the payload.
  #
  # === 'persistent'
  #
  # If this option is set to something else than false or nil, messages
  # messages published by this participant will be persistent (hopefully
  # the queues they'll end up in will be persistent as well).
  #
  #
  # == #encode_workitem
  #
  # The default way to encode a workitem before pushing it to the exchange
  # is by turning it entirely into a JSON string.
  #
  # To alter this, one can subclass this participant and provide its own
  # #encode_workitem(wi) method:
  #
  #   require 'yaml'
  #
  #   class MyAmqpParticipant < Ruote::Amqp::Participant
  #
  #     def encode_workitem(workitem)
  #       YAML.dump(workitem)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # or when one needs to filter some fields:
  #
  #   class MyAmqpParticipant < Ruote::Amqp::Participant
  #
  #     def encode_workitem(workitem)
  #       workitem.fields.delete_if { |k, v| k.match(/^private_/) }
  #       super(workitem)
  #     end
  #   end
  #

    # another on_ method.
