module Ruote::Amqp

  #
  # A receiver is plugged between a ruote engine/storage and an AMQP queue.
  # It will listen on the queue for messages, try to turn them into
  # workitems and feed those workitem back to the engine/storage (in the usual
  # use case, those workitems were initially emitted by the engine).
  #
  # == #decode_message(headers, payload)
  #
  # By default, the receiver expects the incoming workitem to be serialized
  # entirely in the payload of the AMQP message. One can change this
  # behaviour by overriding the #decode_workitem method (usually when
  # subclassing)
  #
  #   class MyYamlReceiver < Ruote::Amqp::Receiver
  #     def decode_message(headers, payload)
  #       YAML.load(payload)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # #decode_message is supposed to return a Ruby hash (describing either a
  # workitem or a launchitem), the difference is explained below.
  #
  # === workitems and launchitems
  #
  # The standard use case is to accept workitems coming back (they probably
  # left the engine via Ruote::Amqp::Participant). But it's also OK
  # to accept "launchitems", hashes with at least one 'process_definition'
  # (or 'definition') entry.
  #
  # Upon receiving a launchitem, the receiver will launch a new process
  # instances.
  #
  # Launchitems may have two more optional entries, 'workitems_fields' (or
  # 'fields') and 'process_variables' (or 'variables').
  #
  # 'workitem_fields' must contain a hash of initial workitem fields (they will
  # populate the initial workitem.
  #
  # 'process_variables' are a very advanced option. It's possible to set the
  # initial variables in a workflow. Read the general ruote documentation to
  # learn about the difference between fields and variables.
  #
  # The #decode_message is supposed to return a hash representing either a
  # workitem, either a launchitem.
  #
  # == #handle_error(err)
  #
  # Out of the box, the receiver will print out to $stderr the details of
  # errors it encounters when receiving, decoding and handing back the
  # workitems (messages?) to the engine. This can be changed by overriding
  # the #handle_error method:
  #
  #   class MyReceiver < Ruote::Amqp::Receiver
  #     def handle_error(err)
  #       ThatLoggerService.log(err)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #
  # == initialization options
  #
  # One can set the "launch_only" option to true when initializing the receiver
  # to prevent it from handling anything but launchitems.
  #
  #   receiver = Ruote::Amqp::Receiver.new(
  #     @dashboard, @amqp_queue, :launch_only => true)
  #
  # 'launch_only' (string) is valid too.
  #
  class Receiver < Ruote::Receiver
